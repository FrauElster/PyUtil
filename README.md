# Utility Library

Hey there. This repository contains the most classes and functions which I used in multiple projects.
There is stuff like file handling, timeouts, multi-threading, logger setup and stuff like that.and

Feel free to use it if you wish, if not let it be.
I am open for pull requests, although its more likely for you to just copy and build upon the files.
